 * Problem Link: https://www.codingninjas.com/studio/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock_1080698
 * Problem Statement:
 * You have been given an array 'PRICES' consisting of 'N' integers where PRICES[i] denotes the price of a given stock
 * on the i-th day. You are also given an integer 'K' denoting the number of possible transactions you can make.
 * Your task is to find the maximum profit in at most K transactions. A valid transaction involves buying a stock and then 
 * selling it.
 * Note: You canâ€™t engage in multiple transactions simultaneously, i.e. you must sell the stock before rebuying it.
 *
